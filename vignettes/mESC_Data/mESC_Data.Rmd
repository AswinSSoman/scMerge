# Introduction 

+ Data source: This mouse embryonic stem cell single cell data was comprised of 3 different batches from a single experiment.

+ `scMerge` parameters for normalisation: (Yingxin will fill this out)

    - Unsupervised scMerge
    - kmeans K = (1,2,3,4)
    - Negative controls are
    - RUV_k
    
    
+ Relation to the `scMerge` article: Main Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 15. 


# Biological novelty

+ This data is relatively small with only the usual batch effects within an experiment. Hence, it was used as an illustrative example for scMerge and also included as an example dataset in our package. 

+ We used this data to illustrate the following properties of `scMerge`:

    1.  High quality normalisation of scRNA-Seq data with batch effects, as shown when comparing [tSNE plots](#tsnePlots) of different normalisation methods.
    2.  The use of scSEGs to perform normalisation is a novel invention to achieve high-quality, [biologically-guided normalisation](#scSEGs).
    3.  [Parameter stability](#kruv) of $k_{RUV}$ in achieving high quality normalisation.
