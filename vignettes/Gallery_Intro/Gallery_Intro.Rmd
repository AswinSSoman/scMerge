# Aim

We aim is to provide a collection of normalised data for users to explore and gain a better understanding of our `scMerge` method. We have demonstrated the capabilities of `scMerge` in a wide collection of scRNA-Seq data with different induced batch effects, including:

+ within batches: [Mouse Liver](../Mouse_Liver_Data/Mouse_Liver_Data.html),
+ across independent data sets,
+ across platforms, and
+ across organisms.


In our gallery, we will aim to provide a brief context to the data we have applied `scMerge` on, outline some of the challenges associated with the data and how `scMerge` was used to reveal novel biological discoveries.
